I am a PhD student at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine studying the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via microRNA (miRNA) in glioblastoma (GBM). 


I attended undergraduate education at Harvey Mudd College, from which I received a degree in Mathematical and Computational Biology.
